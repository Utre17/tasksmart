# TaskSmart Project Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to optimize and clean up the TaskSmart project.

## Project Structure Improvements

1. **Organized API Routes**: 
   - Created dedicated modules for tasks and users in `server/api/`
   - Separated concerns for better maintainability

2. **Added Utils Directory**:
   - Centralized error handling with a consistent format
   - Added reusable utility functions

3. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Removed manual JWT/bcrypt authentication in favor of Firebase
   - Added Helmet for improved HTTP security headers
   - Configured CORS with proper restrictions

## Authentication Improvements

1. **Firebase Integration**:
   - Removed custom JWT, bcrypt, and password handling
   - Implemented Firebase Admin SDK for backend verification
   - Added robust token verification middleware

2. **Role-Based Authorization**:
   - Added support for Firebase custom claims for roles
   - Created admin middleware for protected routes
   - Improved user management endpoints

## API Optimization

1. **RESTful Structure**:
   - Standardized API endpoints following REST conventions
   - Created organized, feature-specific routers
   - Improved error handling with consistent formats

2. **Middleware Improvements**:
   - Added async error handling for all route handlers
   - Implemented ownership verification for user resources
   - Added request logging with privacy considerations

## Frontend Changes

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Added a robust token handling system
   - Implemented better error handling for auth state
   - Added debugging capabilities for troubleshooting

2. **API Integration**:
   - Updated API client to work with Firebase tokens
   - Improved error handling in API requests
   - Added token refresh mechanisms

## Performance & Security

1. **Removed Unnecessary Dependencies**:
   - Eliminated express-session, passport, and bcrypt
   - Added only required security packages (helmet, cors)
   - Streamlined package.json

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Added Helmet for HTTP security headers
   - Configured CORS with proper origin validation
   - Improved request logging (without leaking sensitive data)

## Testing & Documentation

1. **Added Testing Setup**:
   - Created basic tests for authentication flow
   - Added task management tests
   - Set up vitest for testing

2. **Improved Documentation**:
   - Updated README with clear project structure
   - Added setup instructions for Firebase
   - Documented API endpoints and authentication flow

## Environment Configuration

1. **Structured Environment Variables**:
   - Created env.example template
   - Added explicit Firebase configuration
   - Documented all required environment variables

## Future Recommendations

1. **Additional Security**:
   - Consider adding rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Implement additional input validation
   - Add CSRF protection if using cookies

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Consider server-side rendering for initial page load

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Add logging infrastructure (Winston, Pino)
   - Implement error tracking (Sentry)
   - Add performance monitoring
