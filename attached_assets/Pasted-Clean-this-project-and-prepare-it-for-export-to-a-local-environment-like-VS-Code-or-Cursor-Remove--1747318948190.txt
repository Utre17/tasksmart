Clean this project and prepare it for export to a local environment like VS Code or Cursor.
Remove any Replit-specific files like .replit or replit.nix, clean up package.json to remove unused dependencies, create a .env.example file from .env, and organize the file structure using best practices.
Also include comments where needed so I can understand what's what
